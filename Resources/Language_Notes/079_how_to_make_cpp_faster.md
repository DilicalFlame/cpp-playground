### Introduction to Multithreading

The video starts by introducing the concept of **multithreading** and **parallel processing**. Modern CPUs have multiple cores, which allows them to execute multiple instructions at the same time. Multithreading is the key to unlocking this power and can significantly improve the performance of your applications. \[[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWCsmE9DrE&t=0)\]

### The Problem: Slow Loading

The speaker demonstrates a common performance bottleneck in game engines: **slow asset loading**. He shows a C++ program that loads 19 identical 3D models one after another, which takes over 6 seconds to complete. \[[06:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWCsmE9DrE&t=360)\]

### The Opportunity for Optimization

The key insight here is that loading each model is an **independent task**. This makes it a perfect candidate for multithreading. Instead of waiting for one model to load before starting the next, we can dispatch these tasks to separate worker threads to run at the same time. \[[09:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWCsmE9DrE&t=587)\]

### Implementing `std::async` for Parallel Loading

The speaker introduces `std::async` as a way to run tasks asynchronously. He modifies the `LoadMeshes` function to use `std::async` for each model loading operation. \[[10:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWCsmE9DrE&t=619)\]

  * He emphasizes the importance of setting the launch policy to `std::launch::async` to ensure that the task runs on a separate thread.
  * He also points out that you need to store the returned `std::future` objects to prevent the main thread from blocking and waiting for each task to complete immediately.

**Code Example:**

```cpp
// Original synchronous loop
// for (const auto& file : meshFilepaths)
// {
//     m_Meshes.push_back(Mesh::Load(file));
// }

// Asynchronous loading with std::async
for (const auto& file : meshFilepaths)
{
    m_Futures.push_back(std::async(std::launch::async, LoadMesh, &m_Meshes, file));
}
```

### Thread Safety with Mutexes

A critical issue with multithreading is that concurrently pushing elements into the `m_Meshes` vector is not **thread-safe**. When multiple threads try to modify the same resource at the same time, it can lead to data corruption. \[[14:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWCsmE9DrE&t=850)\]

To solve this, the speaker introduces `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard` to protect the `m_Meshes` vector. A mutex ensures that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time.

**Code Example:**

```cpp
static std::mutex s_MeshesMutex; // Declare a static mutex

static void LoadMesh(std::vector<Ref<Mesh>>& meshes, std::string filepath)
{
    auto mesh = Mesh::Load(filepath);
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(s_MeshesMutex); // Lock the mutex
    meshes.push_back(mesh); // Modify the shared resource
    // Mutex is automatically unlocked when 'lock' goes out of scope
}
```

### Performance Improvement

After implementing `std::async` with proper thread safety, the loading time is drastically reduced from over 6 seconds to about **700 milliseconds**â€”a 10x speedup\! ðŸš€ \[[17:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWCsmE9DrE&t=1050)\]

### Conclusion

The video concludes by emphasizing the significant performance gains that can be achieved by leveraging multicore processors through multithreading. This allows for smoother user experiences, such as streaming in assets in games while rendering is already underway. \[[20:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HWCsmE9DrE&t=1240)\]

Since you're into C++ and simulations, you could try applying this to your own projects. For example, you could use `std::async` to speed up complex calculations in your Manim or OpenGL simulations. Happy coding\! ðŸ˜Š
