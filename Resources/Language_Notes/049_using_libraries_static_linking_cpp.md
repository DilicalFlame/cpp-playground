### The Challenge of C++ Libraries

Unlike other languages, C++ can make adding libraries seem complex, but it's actually straightforward once you understand the process \[[00:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=21)\]. The video recommends keeping all dependencies within your project's repository. This way, anyone can clone your project and build it immediately without needing to install external packages \[[00:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=54)\].

### Compiling vs. Pre-built Binaries

You have two main options for using a library \[[01:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=111)\]:

1.  **Build from source**: For serious projects, it's best to build the library's source code yourself. This gives you more control and makes debugging easier \[[02:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=125)\].
2.  **Use pre-built binaries**: For quick projects, linking against pre-built binaries is faster and easier \[[02:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=141)\]. This video focuses on this method.

### Static vs. Dynamic Linking

  * **Static Linking**: The library's code is copied directly into your final executable (`.exe`). This makes your application self-contained but can increase its size \[[06:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=361)\].
  * **Dynamic Linking**: Your application links to the library at runtime, usually through a `.dll` file on Windows. This keeps your executable smaller, but you need to distribute the `.dll` with your application \[[06:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=367)\].

The video recommends **static linking** when possible for simplicity and potential performance benefits \[[06:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=417)\].

### Linking a Library in Visual Studio

Here's a step-by-step guide to linking a library, using GLFW as an example \[[07:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=459)\]:

1.  **Organize your files**: Create a `dependencies` folder in your solution directory and place the library's `include` and `lib` folders inside it \[[08:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=498)\].

2.  **Set up include directories**: In your project's properties, go to **C/C++ -\> General -\> Additional Include Directories** and add the path to the library's `include` folder. Using a relative path like `$(SolutionDir)dependencies\GLFW\include` is a good practice \[[10:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=616)\].

    ```cpp
    #include <GLFW/glfw3.h> // Use angle brackets for external libraries
    ```

3.  **Set up library directories**: Go to **Linker -\> General -\> Additional Library Directories** and add the path to the library's `lib` folder \[[14:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=882)\].

4.  **Link the library file**: Go to **Linker -\> Input -\> Additional Dependencies** and add the name of the static library file (e.g., `glfw3.lib`) \[[14:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=888)\].

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

    int main() {
        if (glfwInit()) {
            std::cout << "GLFW initialized successfully!" << std::endl;
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```

### Common Issues

  * **Unresolved External Symbol**: This linker error means you haven't correctly linked the library. Double-check your library paths and dependencies \[[13:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=820)\].

  * **`extern "C"`**: If you're using a C library in a C++ project, you might need to wrap its function declarations in `extern "C"` to prevent C++ name mangling \[[16:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or1dAmUO8k0&t=999)\].

    ```cpp
    extern "C" int glfwInit();
    ```
