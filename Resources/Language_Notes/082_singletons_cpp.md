### **Important Concepts**

  * **What is a Singleton?** üßê

      * A Singleton is a design pattern that restricts a class to have **only one instance** and provides a global point of access to it. \[[02:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPup1yeU45I&t=152)\]
      * Essentially, it's a way to manage global variables and functions within a single, organized class structure. \[[06:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPup1yeU45I&t=417)\]

  * **Why Use a Singleton?** ü§î

      * It's useful for managing resources that should only be created once, like a **renderer** in a game engine or a **random number generator**. \[[05:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPup1yeU45I&t=317)\] You set it up once and then access it from anywhere in your application.

  * **Core Implementation Details** üõ†Ô∏è

      * **Private Constructor**: To prevent anyone from creating an instance of the class directly, the constructor is made `private`. \[[07:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPup1yeU45I&t=455)\]
      * **Deleted Copy Constructor**: To stop accidental copying of the single instance, the copy constructor is explicitly deleted using `= delete`. \[[10:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPup1yeU45I&t=610)\]
      * **Static `GetInstance` Method**: A `public static` method is provided to get a reference to the single instance of the class. \[[07:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPup1yeU45I&t=473)\]
      * **Static Local Instance (Preferred Method)**: The cleanest way to implement the singleton is by declaring the instance as a `static` local variable inside the `GetInstance` method. This ensures it's created only on the first call and its lifetime matches the application's. \[[15:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPup1yeU45I&t=904)\]

  * **Singleton vs. Namespace** üÜö

      * In C++, you can achieve a similar result using a `namespace` with static variables and functions. \[[16:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPup1yeU45I&t=1011)\]
      * However, a **class-based Singleton** offers better encapsulation and organization, allowing for private members and a clearer distinction between the public interface and internal implementation. \[[17:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPup1yeU45I&t=1048)\]

### **Code Examples**

Here are the key code structures discussed in the video.

#### **Basic Singleton Structure**

This shows the private constructor and the static `GetInstance` method.

```cpp
// In Singleton.h
class Singleton
{
private:
    Singleton() {} // Private constructor
    static Singleton s_Instance; // Declaration of the static instance

public:
    static Singleton& GetInstance()
    {
        return s_Instance;
    }
};

// In Singleton.cpp
Singleton Singleton::s_Instance; // Definition of the static instance
```

#### **Preventing Copies**

To make the Singleton more robust, the copy constructor is deleted.

```cpp
class Singleton
{
private:
    Singleton() {}
    Singleton(const Singleton& other) = delete; // Deleted copy constructor

public:
    static Singleton& GetInstance()
    {
        // ...
    }
};
```

#### **Preferred Implementation (Random Number Generator Example)**

This example uses a static local variable inside `GetInstance` and exposes functionality through public static methods. This is a very clean and common way to write a Singleton in C++.

```cpp
class Random
{
private:
    Random() {} // Private constructor
    Random(const Random& other) = delete; // Deleted copy constructor

    float m_RandomGenerator = 0.5f; // Member data

    // Internal implementation function
    float IFloat()
    {
        return m_RandomGenerator;
    }

public:
    // The GetInstance method with a static local variable
    static Random& GetInstance()
    {
        static Random instance; // Created only once on the first call
        return instance;
    }

    // Public static function that provides access to the functionality
    static float Float()
    {
        return GetInstance().IFloat();
    }
};

// How to use it from anywhere in your code:
// float myRandomNumber = Random::Float(); [00:14:06]
```

This pattern is super useful for many things in C++, especially in game development or any application where you need a single, globally accessible service. Since you're into programming, you could try implementing a simple logger or a resource manager using this pattern for one of your projects\!
