## Local `static` Variables: Lifetime vs. Scope

The video explains the difference between a variable's **lifetime** (how long it exists in memory) and its **scope** (where you can access it in your code) \[[00:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mtWD9GdJ4&t=23)\].

A **local `static` variable** is special because:

  * It has the **lifetime of the entire program**, just like a global variable \[[00:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mtWD9GdJ4&t=51)\].
  * Its **scope is limited to the function or block** where it's declared.

This is a powerful feature because it lets you have a variable that "remembers" its value between function calls without cluttering the global namespace.

## `static` in Action: A Simple Counter

Hereâ€™s a practical example from the video that demonstrates the power of `static` \[[01:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mtWD9GdJ4&t=103)\]:

### Without `static`

```cpp
void function() {
    int i = 0; // 'i' is re-created and set to 0 every time
    i++;
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
}
```

If you call this function five times, the output will be:

```
1
1
1
1
1
```

### With `static`

```cpp
void function() {
    static int i = 0; // 'i' is created once and keeps its value
    i++;
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
}
```

Calling this function five times now gives you:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

As you can see, the `static` variable `i` retains its value across calls, which is super useful for things like counters or state management within a function.

## A Cleaner Way to Implement Singletons

The video also shows how to use a local `static` variable to create a **Singleton** class, which is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance. This is a much cleaner approach than the traditional method \[[04:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mtWD9GdJ4&t=261)\].

### The Old Way (More Verbose)

```cpp
class Singleton {
public:
    static Singleton* s_instance;
    static Singleton& Get() {
        // ... logic to create the instance ...
        return *s_instance;
    }
    void Hello() { /* ... */ }
};

Singleton* Singleton::s_instance = nullptr; // External definition needed
```

### The `static` Way (Cleaner and Simpler)

```cpp
class Singleton {
public:
    static Singleton& Get() {
        static Singleton instance; // Created only once, when Get() is first called
        return instance;
    }
    void Hello() { /* ... */ }
};
```

This modern C++ approach is more concise and avoids the need for an external definition. It's a great example of how `static` can help you write more elegant code.
