### What is Continuous Integration?

* CI is the practice of automating the build and testing of code every time a developer commits changes to a repository \[[00:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=7)\].
* It helps catch bugs early, prevent compilation failures across different platforms, and ensure the software remains stable as multiple developers contribute \[[00:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=22), [01:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=102)\].
* The fundamental idea is to build the code and run tests after every single commit to get immediate feedback \[[02:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=133)\].

### Project and Jenkins Setup

* The video demonstrates setting up a C++ project that will be automatically built and tested by Jenkins whenever a new commit is pushed to GitHub \[[02:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=149)\].
* **`Jenkinsfile`**: This is the core configuration file that tells Jenkins what to do. It's structured in stages, like "build" and "test" \[[04:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=258), [05:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=329)\].
    * **Build Stage**: This stage runs a build script. The script in the video uses `premake` to generate makefiles and then `make` to compile the C++ code. The compiled executable is then saved as a build artifact \[[05:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=334)\].
    * **Test Stage**: This stage executes a run script to launch the program and check its output \[[06:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=372)\].
* **Project Structure**:
    * `premake5.lua`: A file to configure the project build \[[04:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=276)\].
    * `scripts/`: Contains the build and run shell scripts (`LinuxBuild.sh`, `LinuxRun.sh`) \[[04:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=287)\].
    * `helloworld/helloworld.cpp`: The simple C++ source code \[[05:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=306)\].
* **Setting up Jenkins on Linode**:
    * A Jenkins server is easily deployed on Linode using their one-click app marketplace \[[06:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=396)\].
    * After deployment, you finish the setup via the web browser, install suggested plugins, and create an admin user \[[07:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=442), [07:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=462)\].

### Integrating Jenkins with GitHub

* **Pipeline Creation**: A new pipeline is created in Jenkins to automate the CI process for the GitHub repository \[[08:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=503)\].
* **GitHub Access Token**: To allow Jenkins to access your repository, you need to generate a personal access token in your GitHub developer settings with repository and webhook permissions \[[08:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=515)\].
* **Connecting to GitHub**: The token is used in Jenkins to connect to your GitHub organization and select the repository \[[09:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=542)\].
* **Troubleshooting**: The initial build might fail if necessary tools like `git`, `make`, and `g++` are not installed on the Jenkins server. These can be installed using `apt-get` on the server's command line \[[09:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=564), [09:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=580)\].
* **Successful Build**: Once the tools are installed, the pipeline runs successfully. The build and test stages will pass, and the output from the program ("hello world") will be visible in the Jenkins logs \[[10:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=610)\]. The compiled program is also available as a downloadable artifact \[[11:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=663)\].

### Automating Builds with Webhooks

* To trigger builds automatically on every push to the repository, a **webhook** is set up in the GitHub repository's settings \[[11:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=697)\].
* The webhook URL is your Jenkins server address followed by `/github-webhook/`. This tells GitHub to send a notification to Jenkins every time a push event occurs \[[11:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=707)\].
* The video demonstrates this by changing the "hello world" message to "hello Jenkins," pushing the commit, and showing that Jenkins instantly starts a new build and displays the updated output \[[12:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=743), [12:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPtchw-eHA&t=766)\].
