### Key Concepts

  * **Undefined Behavior**: The C++ standard **does not specify the order** in which function arguments are evaluated \[[04:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=282)\]. This means the same code can produce different results on different compilers (like MSVC, GCC, Clang) or even in debug versus release builds \[[04:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=289)\]. Relying on a specific evaluation order leads to unreliable and non-portable code.
  * **Compiler Optimizations**: Compilers are free to optimize how they evaluate arguments. This can lead to surprising outcomes, especially with increment operators. For instance, in release mode, a compiler might perform "constant folding" and evaluate expressions at compile time, leading to unexpected results \[[06:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=395)\].
  * **C++17 Update**: While the overall order is still undefined, C++17 introduced a rule that postfix expressions (like `value++`) must be evaluated sequentially, not at the same time \[[07:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=455)\]. This prevents them from being evaluated as the exact same value, though the order (`1 + 0` vs. `0 + 1`) is still not guaranteed \[[08:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=490)\].

### Code Examples

The video uses a simple `printSum` function to demonstrate the issue:

```cpp
void printSum(int a, int b) {
    // Prints something like: "1 + 0 = 1"
}
```

The core of the demonstration is calling this function with post-increment operators:

```cpp
int value = 0;
printSum(value++, value++);
```

Here's how different compilers and settings handled this:

  * **MSVC (Debug)**: `1 + 0 = 1` \[[05:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=311)\]
  * **MSVC (Release)**: `0 + 0 = 0` (due to optimization) \[[05:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=327)\]
  * **Clang (C++20)**: `0 + 1 = 1` \[[09:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=561)\]
  * **GCC (C++20)**: `1 + 0 = 1` \[[08:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=534)\]

Both GCC and Clang also helpfully provide warnings about this undefined behavior \[[09:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=540), [09:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=572)\].

### Conclusion

The main takeaway is that you should **never** write code that depends on the order in which function arguments are evaluated. It's considered **undefined behavior** \[[09:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYxTP7wrCho&t=592)\]. The C++17 update provides some guarantees for postfix expressions, but the fundamental principle remains: write clear, unambiguous code that doesn't rely on compiler-specific quirks. This is a fantastic C++ "gotcha" to be aware of\! ðŸ’¡
