### **Primary Difference: Default Member Visibility**

The main distinction between a `class` and a `struct` in C++ lies in their **default visibility**.

  * **Classes**: Members are `private` by default. If you don't specify `public` or `private`, members of a class cannot be accessed from outside the class.

    ```cpp
    class Player {
        void Move() {
            // This function is private by default
        }
    };

    // player.Move(); // This would result in a compile-time error.
    ```

    To make members accessible, you must explicitly declare them as `public`.

    ```cpp
    class Player {
    public:
        void Move() {
            // Now this function can be accessed from outside the class.
        }
    };
    ```

  * **Structs**: Members are `public` by default. You don't need to use the `public` keyword for members to be accessible from outside the struct.

    ```cpp
    struct Player {
        void Move() {
            // This function is public by default
        }
    };

    // player.Move(); // This works without any issues.
    ```

    If you need to make a member private, you must explicitly use the `private` keyword.

    ```cpp
    struct Player {
    private:
        void Move() {
            // This function is now private.
        }
    };
    ```

### **Historical Context & C Compatibility**

The `struct` keyword exists in C++ largely for **backward compatibility with the C programming language**. C uses structs to group data, but it does not have classes. C++ introduced classes to support object-oriented programming, and to maintain compatibility, it retained structs but gave them class-like capabilities.

### **Semantic Differences & Common Usage**

While you can use `struct` and `class` almost interchangeably by explicitly setting member visibility, the C++ community generally follows a convention for their use:

  * **Structs for Plain Old Data (POD)**: Structs are often used for simple data containers that don't have complex logic or invariants. A good example is a mathematical vector, which primarily holds data.

    ```cpp
    struct Vec2 {
        float x, y;

        void Add(const Vec2& other) {
            x += other.x;
            y += other.y;
        }
    };
    ```

  * **Classes for Complex Objects**: Classes are typically used to represent more complex entities that have their own behaviors and responsibilities. This is especially true when dealing with concepts like inheritance or resource management. For example, a `Player` class in a game might handle rendering, physics, and input.
